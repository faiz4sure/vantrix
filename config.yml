  # ROLES TO IGNORE IN MEMBER UPDATES
  # Add role IDs here that should NOT trigger anti-nuke when assigned/removed
  # Useful for onboarding roles, autoroles, and other legitimate auto-assignments
  # In simple terms, put the role ids of non harmful roles which you have configured as onboarding or autoroles in your server
  # Get role IDs by right-clicking roles in Server Settings > Roles
  ignored_role_ids: [""] # ← ADD YOUR ROLE IDs HERE (e.g., ["123456789", "987654321"])

  # OPTIONS: "Discord Client", "Chrome", "Firefox", "Discord iOS", "Discord Android"
  browser: "Discord Client"

# VANITY URL PROTECTION
vanity_reversion:
  # YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD (REQUIRED FOR VANITY REVERSION)
  # IMPORTANT: This is required for the bot to authenticate with Discord's MFA system
  #           to revert unauthorized vanity URL changes. Without this, the bot can
  #           still punish attackers but cannot automatically restore the vanity URL.
  # WARNING:  - Keep this password secure and never share it
  #           - If this field is incorrect or empty, punishment will occur but
  #             vanity reversion will fail silently
  #           - The bot will continue working normally without this feature
  password: "" # ← PUT YOUR DISCORD ACCOUNT PASSWORD HERE

  # FALLBACK VANITY CODE
  # Most of the time Discord's event data isn't cached properly and oldVanity comes as undefined/null
  # In such cases, the bot will revert to this vanity code instead of failing
  # IMPORTANT: Put ONLY the vanity code (e.g., "myserver"), NOT the full link (discord.gg/myserver)
  # If left empty, the bot will remove the vanity URL when old vanity is unavailable
  # This ensures your server ALWAYS has a working vanity URL after an attack
  fallback_vanity: "" # ← PUT YOUR VANITY CODE HERE (just "myserver", not "discord.gg/myserver")

# VANITY PROTECTION MODE
# "normal" - balanced, uses audit logs for attacker detection 
# "audit"  - uses guildAuditLogEntryCreate event for detection (recommended)
# "fast"   - instant reversion, no punishment, maximum speed
vanity_mode: "audit"
