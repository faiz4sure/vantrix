# PROTECTION SETTINGS - WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE RAIDS
antinuke_settings:
  # WHAT TO DO WHEN SELFBOT DETECTS AN ATTACKER
  punishment: "ban"  # Options: "ban", "kick", or "none"
  
  auto_recovery: true # Automatically recover the channels and roles that were harmed
  recover_channels: true  # Recover deleted channels
  recover_roles: true     # Recover deleted roles
  recover_kicks: true    # Send DM invites for kicked users (experimental)
  recovery_delay: 1500     # Milliseconds to wait between recoveries
  
  # HOW MANY ACTIONS TRIGGER THE PROTECTION
  # If someone does more than this number of actions in the time window, they're caught
  ban_limit: 5                # Triggers if someone bans 5+ people quickly
  kick_limit: 5               # Triggers if someone kicks 5+ people quickly
  channel_create_limit: 5     # Triggers if someone creates 5+ channels quickly
  role_create_limit: 5        # Triggers if someone creates 5+ roles quickly
  channel_delete_limit: 5     # Triggers if someone deletes 5+ channels quickly
  role_delete_limit: 5        # Triggers if someone deletes 5+ roles quickly

  unban_limit: 5              # Triggers if someone unbans 5+ people quickly

  # ROLES TO IGNORE IN MEMBER UPDATES
  # Add role IDs here that should NOT trigger anti-nuke when assigned/removed
  # Useful for onboarding roles, autoroles, and other legitimate auto-assignments
  # In simple terms, put the role ids of non harmful roles which you have configured as onboarding or autoroles in your server
  # Get role IDs by right-clicking roles in Server Settings > Roles
  ignored_role_ids: [""]  # ← ADD YOUR ROLE IDs HERE (e.g., ["123456789", "987654321"])
  
  # TIME WINDOW FOR COUNTING ACTIONS (IN MILLISECONDS)
  # 36000000 = 10 hours, 3600000 = 1 hour, 600000 = 10 minutes
  time_window: 36000000    

# LOGGING SETTINGS - WHERE TO SEND ALERTS
logs:  
  # WHAT TYPES OF EVENTS TO LOG

  # AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE STATUS MESSAGE?
  rotation: true

# VANITY URL PROTECTION - ADVANCED FEATURE
# This allows the bot to automatically revert unauthorized vanity URL changes
vanity_reversion:
  # YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD (REQUIRED FOR VANITY REVERSION)
  # IMPORTANT: This is required for the bot to authenticate with Discord's MFA system
  #           to revert unauthorized vanity URL changes. Without this, the bot can
  #           still punish attackers but cannot automatically restore the vanity URL.
  # WARNING:  - Keep this password secure and never share it
  #           - If this field is incorrect or empty, punishment will occur but
  #             vanity reversion will fail silently
  #           - The bot will continue working normally without this feature
  password: ""  # ← PUT YOUR DISCORD ACCOUNT PASSWORD HERE

  # FALLBACK VANITY CODE (OPTIONAL - RECOMMENDED)
  # Most of the time Discord's event data isn't cached properly and oldVanity comes as undefined/null
  # In such cases, the bot will revert to this vanity code instead of failing
  # IMPORTANT: Put ONLY the vanity code (e.g., "myserver"), NOT the full link (discord.gg/myserver)
  # If left empty, the bot will remove the vanity URL when old vanity is unavailable
  # This ensures your server ALWAYS has a working vanity URL after an attack
  fallback_vanity: ""  # ← PUT YOUR VANITY CODE HERE (just "myserver", not "discord.gg/myserver")
